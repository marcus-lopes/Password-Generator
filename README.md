# Description

My motivation to start this project is to gain more experience for my career.

## Installation

-Initiation-

When I started this project, I had the intention of making a "password maker" that creates passwords with characters that the customer thinks is best.

# Usage

![alt text](./password%20maker.png)
In this site we have a simple html and css, but we have a button "Generate password" that when clicked appears a series of prompts with criteria for password.

Once the customer selects their password requirements, a password is created in the box above the button.
